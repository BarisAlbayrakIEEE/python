## 1. About The Repository <a id='sec1'></a>

This repository is a part of the portfolio to illustrate my software engineering experience.
This repository especially demonstrates my skills and capabilities in python language.

The repository currently includes the following items:
- The solutions to [Project Euler problems](#https://projecteuler.net/).

I will add new solutions by the time:
- A simple machine learning project working on the **generic sales data** of a supermarket.

## 2. Repository Review <a id='sec2'></a>

Currently, the repository contains the following subdirectories:
- [The project euler problems](#https://projecteuler.net/).

### 2.1. The Project Euler problems <a id='sec21'></a>

Currently, the subdirectory contains the following modules:
- Collatz conjecture (Project Euler Problem 14),
- Langton's Ant (Project Euler Problem 349).

See the docstrings of the modules involving a detailed description of the problem and the solution.
