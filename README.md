## 1. About The Repository <a id='sec1'></a>

This repository is a part of the portfolio to illustrate my software engineering experience.
This repository especially demonstrates my skills and capabilities in python language.

The repository currently includes the following items:
- The solutions to [Project Euler problems](#https://projecteuler.net/).

I will add new solutions by the time:
- A simple machine learning project working on **generic sales data** of a supermarket.

## 2. Repository Review <a id='sec2'></a>

Currently, the repository contains the following modules:
- The solutions to [Project Euler problems](#https://projecteuler.net/):
1. Collatz conjecture (problem 14),
2. Langtons Ant (problem 349).

### 2.1. Collatz conjecture (Project Euler Problem 14) <a id='sec21'></a>

See the module docstring involving a detailed description of the problem and the solution.

### 2.1. Langton's Ant (Project Euler Problem 349) <a id='sec21'></a>

See the module docstring involving a detailed description of the problem and the solution.
Additionally, the directory contains two modules:
1. PE_P349_LangtonsAnt.py
2. PE_P349_LangtonsAnt_Modern.py: A modern solution improving the traditional solution.

The 1st one demonstrates a brute force solution looping through the path of the ant.
The modern solution improves the brute force approach in two ways:
- the definition of the move of the ant and
- the pattern detection algorithm.

See the docstring of PE_P349_LangtonsAnt_Modern.py for the details.
